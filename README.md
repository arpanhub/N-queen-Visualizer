# N-Queens Visualizer

N-Queens Visualizer is a web-based tool to visualize the solution of the classic N-Queens problem, where N queens must be placed on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a sleek and responsive user interface.

## Features

- Dynamic control for the number of queens (N) from 4 to 20.
- Adjustable visualization speed.
- Real-time visual representation of the algorithm's progress.
- Displays all possible solutions for the given N.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.
